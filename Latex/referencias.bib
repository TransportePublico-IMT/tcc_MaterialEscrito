abstract = {Nowadays, there are many challenges for the logistics industry mainly with the integration of E-commerce and new sources of data such as smartphones, sensors, GPS and other devices. Those new data sources generate daily a huge quantity of unstructured data, to deal with such complex data, the use of big data analytic tools becomes an obligation. In this context, many works have been done recently in the integration of big data analytics in the logistics industry. In this paper, we propose to give a review of the latest applications of big data analytics in the field of logistics and transportation industry and to propose a novel approach to detect and recognize containers code based on a Hadoop big data analytics system.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multi-output regression model for crowd counting in public scenes. Existing counting by regression methods either learn a single model for global counting, or train a large number of separate regressors for localised density estimation. In contrast, our single regression model based approach is able to estimate people count in spatially localised regions and is more scalable without the need for training a large number of regressors proportional to the number of local regions. In particular, the proposed model automatically learns the functional mapping between interdependent low-level features and multi-dimensional structured outputs. The model is able to discover the inherent importance of different features for people counting at different spatial locations. Extensive evaluations on an existing crowd analysis benchmark dataset and a new more challenging dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Our method takes into account feature normalization to deal with perspective projection and different camera orientation. The training features include edge orientation and blob size histograms resulted from edge detection and background subtraction. A density map that measures the relative size of individuals and a global scale measuring camera orientation are estimated and used for feature normalization. The relationship between the feature histograms and the number of pedestrians in the crowds is learned from labeled training data. Experimental results from different sites with different camera orientation demonstrate the performance and the potential of our method. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {In the past few years a growing number of cities have started monitoring the position of public transportation vehicles using GPS devices. In this paper, we focus on a particularly important urban dataset: GPS bus data. Buses are valuable sensors and information associated with buses can provide unprecedented insight into many different aspects of city's life, from human behavior to mobility patterns. But analyzing these large urban datasets presents many challenges. Urban datasets are complex, containing location and temporal components in addition that they are commonly released in their raw format. Furthermore, urban datasets may have noisy and missing data, locations gathered in a low sampling rate and not mapped to the underlying road network, among other issues which makes it difficult for citizens, administrators and developers to get insights. In this paper, we present a system, called USapiens, for analyzing large urban trajectory data. We first describe the architecture of the proposed system for pre-processing and analyzing urban trajectory data. We then detail five use cases we build using very large GPS dataset obtained from buses operating in the city of Rio de Janeiro to get insights into various aspects of public transportation in the city.},

Full use is made of the so called "alpha-beta" pruning and several forms of forward pruning to restrict the spread of the move tree and to permit the program to look ahead to a much greater depth than it otherwise could do. While still unable to outplay checker masters, the program's playing ability has been greatly improved. Introduction Limited progress has been made in the development of an improved book-learning technique and in the optimization of playing strategies as applied to the checker playing program described in an earlier paper with this same title.' Because of the sharpening in our understanding and the substantial improvements in playing ability that have resulted from these recent studies, a reporting at this time seems desirable. Unfortunately, the most basic limitation of the known machine learning techniques, as previously outlined , has not yet been overcome nor has the program been able to outplay the best human checker players? We will briefly review the earlier work. The reader who does not find this review adequate might do well to refresh his memory by referring to the earlier paper.},
